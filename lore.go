there's no way to flee, there's no way to hide,
no hope, no rest, no friend, no might,
my eyes are hurting, life is no lie.”

`,

this is my dark kingdom,
here I abide, far from the night,
far from the light, far from the sky.
And there I'll die.
I won't retire.”

[Fragment of the Ballad of the Dark Orc]
`,
	`“Cold… So cold… There's something wrong in here. I can tell there were saijits living in this place. But now… there are nothing but monsters. Monsters everywhere! And fear is so cold. So cold…!”

[Blood-stained piece of paper, Anonym]
`,
	`“If flowers are gone,
I'll seed them again,
If darkness has won
I'll fight it again.”

I don't mind if I die,

I've lost them both,
I'm orphan now.”

I love her cheerful mind and might,
I will protect her with my life,
she will be freed, I will stand last.”

[Fragment of a message signed Knight Firo of Ombay]
`,
	`“[…] When I saw him, the child laughed. He stuck out his tongue, cheerfully ran away, and passed through a hole in the wall like a mouse. A milfid was coming, so I followed him, but then, when I searched for him, he was not here. Maybe he was just an illusion… but he saved my life.”

[Fragment of the Scientist's diary]
`,
	`“For this beam of peace I saw once in my life
I will hold my promise and cling to my last days,
I will raise this old knife, and then… come what may.”

[Fragment of Hope springs eternal, by Mowsh Rasadekarda]
`,
	`“Someone told me once these words:
whenever I cross your path,
something unexpected comes.
I couldn't refrain a smile.”

[Very old piece of paper signed Marevor Helith]
`,
	`“Here I am, I, Marevor Helith the nakrus, the former necromancer, roaming, surrounded by the shadows that had seen me changing into a living dead so long ago.

I'm happy. I don't hate monsters. They were the only living creatures that could see me without cringing in a long, long time. Their presence soothed me during my transformation and my early dead life. I even enjoy them being there during my random walks through those corridors, in this lovely peaceful dungeon. Yacks, nixes, nadres, vampires… To all of you, guys, I'll be always grateful!”

[White paper signed Marevor Helith]
`,
	`“If you want to revive
don't be hasty,
there's a way to thrive,
but the method, my dear,
is so, so nasty.”

[Fragment of Beware of eternal life, by Marevor Helith]
`,
	`“I love life, I love hope,
y'all up there, listen up!
I won't ever give up.
If I'm lying down there,
don't be fooled,
I'm just taking a break.”

[Fragment of Red-Snake Naran's Diary]
`,
	`“La malbono grandas en la mallumo, sed la espero pli grandas en la koroj.”

`,
	`“Ho, ve, monstro terura! Vi ne povas vidi min, ne rigardu, ne plu revenu, ne plu revenu, ne plu revenu…”

don't be hasty, all's alright,
you can save yourself tomorrow

[Green piece of paper, seems to be a piece of advice for someone]
`,
	`Graved on the floor, in blood, you can see some letters that say:

“Beware, you mortal, you'll be next.”
`,
	`“It was so beautiful! All over the place, in Kaendra valley, flowers were blooming, red, blue, white and yellow. The breeze was tousling my hair like a gentle god. My cat, on the threshold, was meowing. My children were running down the hill. And then, everything was gone.

I just can't believe it was a dream. I wanted so much to be back home and be far from this damned dungeon… I know that, if I keep fighting, I'll die for sure. From now on, I will hide. And I will get out of here from sure. Home is waiting for me.”

[A long page written in a rather hurried way. It is accompanied by the drawings of two children, most likely the author's]
`,
	`“Damned, damned kerejats! If it wasn't because of the light of these butterflies, they wouldn't have seen me. Luckily I'm small and I got in a barrel. But it was close. For Karihesat's sake, I hate those butterflies…”

[Piece of paper signed: The Hobbit Who Doesn't Want To Die]
`,
	`“I found a magara of noise! I'm so happy. I don't know how to use it, but anyway, I'm happy.”

[Blue piece of paper]
`,
	`“I was sent here to do something very urgent. That's why I was given so much help, my Elders told me to be cautious and not to use my sword if I could avoid it. I felt honoured and proud when I left. The only thing is… after I fell off the stairs, I don't remember a thing of what I'm supposed to do.

After so many days… guess I'd be better off not coming back.”

[Notes signed: He who doesn't remember got to be a dungeon ward]
`,
	`“Earth is warm and sun is bright,
I will never lose your sight.
Even deep in the Undergrounds,
I will have you in my heart,
deep down in my sunny past.”

[Slightly burned piece of paper signed: The Wizard who can't resign]
`,
	`“Come on, move and make my day.
Just try! Take my life away.
You will be doomed anyway.
Those monsters who went astray
never crossed my path again.”

[Text engraved in the stone floor with fierceness, signed: the Frightening One]
`,
	`“Ha! Dear, dear, big evil yack! Running, I passed through the hole. And you crashed into the wall. You made me laugh so hard I thought I would die.”

[Piece of paper signed: Marvarelia, the Little Dark Elf]
`,
	`“There was a loud sound somewhere in the dungeon… A hound? A dragon? Whatever. I don't want to know.”

[Piece of thick paper, anonym]
`,
	`“Someone told me that was a good place to find bananas. I thought he was joking. But now that I'm here, I know he wasn't. The Undergrounds banana trees are so rare! They don't seem to even need a source of moonstone light. That's my chance to shine! I'll keep studying them as much as I can.”

[The rest of the paper is full of signs you don't understand. It's not Abrianese. You sigh: those saijits really make things complicated…]
`,
	`“No rival for me to kill
that's some kind of an ordeal,
no one's life for me to steal
please, come back, and pay the bill.”

[Fragment of a poem entitled The Greedy Raven, the rest of the letters have faded]
`,
	`“If you want to live on, run away and go home,
if you want to say hello, it's this way, come on, come…”

[The message is carved in stone. You think: yeah, hello… And you nervously look for a barrel]
`,
	`“Just a bit earlier, I climbed a tree to see a little farther. There was a kerejat butterfly shining in the distance. However, a milfid happened to see me and attacked me… Though I'm a gawalt, I ran away as fast as an arrow.”

[You blink at the paper, surprised. A gawalt? A gawalt monkey like you wrote that? Then, you smile: I will, too, run like an arrow!]
`,
	`“Rather than being smashed and eaten,
gather your will, stop to think.
You won't have your legend written
but you'll still be able to drink.”

[Fragment of the poem The Mouse And The Dragon, by Dak Limisur]
`,
	`“All my childhood, I kept complaining: I'm not a coward! Now I understand that cowardice may be a blessing.”

[Rafiluna the Goblin Coward]
`,
	`“I wonder why monsters exist. I wonder why we, saijits, exist. Why are we eating each other? What for have we been created? Are we even real?”

[The page is rather long… Snorting, you stop reading. Crazy saijits, that's too much]
`,
	`“Let's see… You were a shoemaker, you have good ideals, you want to make a better world, you like sunny days and you love birds. Man… Why in the world do you want to join a clan like ours?”

[Interview with an applicant for the Dark Dayoriah Clan]
`,
	`“I was pursued and used my magara of levitation to pass over the chasm… But I was so scared, I couldn't go on fast enough. I wound up falling, down and down. And there I am, deeper in the dungeon, hopeless as never before. And wounds hurt. Damn, they hurt.”

[Fragment of an old diary signed Jiffy Low]
`,
	`“The ceremony didn't go as I expected. It wasn't a feast. It was a funeral. They half-buried me in a huge mound of mud, sang as if their throats were going to change into stone, and then they freed me, allowed me to wear their black tunic, and shared with me a cup of blood.

It was my blood they were drinking. It was their blood I was drinking. I was them, they were me. That's the thinking of the Dark Dayoriah Clan: everyone is one, no one will be ever alone…”

[Namyfar's thoughts about the infiltration of the Dayoriah Clan in the late 80' of the 55th century]
`,
	`“I seem to be a traitor. I just can't understand why. The Dayoriah Clan is chasing me, they say I was thinking too much and acting without permission… I'm scared. I don't want to lose my friends. But now I'm afraid of them… Just please, please, brethren, forgive me.”

[Piece of paper signed with a blooded cross]
`,
	`“Believe me, mom, this Dayoriah clan will give me power. They have oric experts, and harmonists experts; their celmists are really good ones! Even from our village I've heard wonders about their learning, but that's above my expectations! They told me that they will train me, so I will give my best and definitely join them. I don't care if they are seen like demons by others. Strong, resilient, obstinate… They are just what I am looking for!”

[Undelivered old letter signed: your son, Mel]
`,
	`“We'll be one,
never alone,
we'll be one,
and always strong.”

[Written words of an anonymous Dayoriah Clan member]
`,
	`“Please,
please, forgive them all who thought they could run away from your wrath,
Children of Dayoriah,
take those poor souls in your heart and remember they could have become your brothers-in-arms.”

[Dayoriah Clan's Prayer for the Taken Souls]
`,
	`“Yesterday in my heart
a white flower has bloomed,
it told me: don't cry now,
for you're already doomed.”

[Poem entitled: Don't let the bastards wear you down]
`,
	`“«Why? Why do you try so hard to save me?», the young apprentice asked, panting for breath. His hooded comrade didn't even look at him when he answered in a cold tone: «If I don't even try, I'll never be able to call you a friend.»”

[Piece of paper of a mangled novel]
`,
	`“Go on. Don't look behind.
Nothing good you will find.
There are nothing but ghosts,
ghosts that will cost your life.”

[Fragment of Ghosts of the Past, by Yaylin Ekath (5541-?)]
`,
	`“I was chasing a dog,
it then entered a pound,
I swam fast, I swam fast,
I left it soon behind.”

[Piece of paper, The Mirol Man who Swam Faster than Dogs]
`,
	`“Now! Cut the branch of your life,
make it stronger, make it darker,
can't you see? Nothing bad happens,
you're just a bit more like us…”

[Words written by a Dayoriah Clan Oric Celmist called Chuvitsan.]
`,
	`“That silly drow… I'm sick of him. During our watch, he kept on talking till I thought I'd get mad. He just doesn't understand what the Dayoriah Clan is. He talks about his children, his wife, his expectations, his dream about becoming one day a merchant… He didn't even realize I wasn't answering.

Does he think everyone here is just as happy and dreamy as he is? So naive it hurts me… Hope he will escape and survive. Otherwise, that poor guy will never become a merchant. Can't tell him, though.”

[Thoughts of Xorom, an Elder Guard of the Dayoriah Clan]
`,
	`“Cling! clang! clong…! Are they water drops on a queenstone? It makes so much noise. Cling, clang, clong… I am so tired I could fall asleep even with that dreadful sound. But perhaps something wrong is happening over there. I will go and take a look.”

[Mimi the Guard]
`,
	`“The thief that infiltrated our turf and tried to retrieve our new acquisition has been captured. However, it is possible that she has an accomplice. Please be careful and stop every suspect.”

[Order of a Dayoriah Clan's foreman, the paper is rather recent and you can't help but think the thief is actually Shaedra. So they really did capture her! You have to hurry and save her.]
`,
	`“What have you done, young novice? You are but weak, useless, worthless, and you still want to eat with us, the Dayoriah Guards? You don't seem to understand your place. Just crawl, crawl until we just see in you a mere worm. Maybe then, you'll get some leftovers.

The worm who would climb the ladder must begin at the bottom.”

[Piece of paper wet with tears]
`,
	`“I've always lived in the Dayoriah Clan, so maybe I'm biased and the world is just as much rotten as my clan is… I want to believe it isn't. My clan was once a great place to live in. They were kind, they were wise. They just loved knowledge so badly they ended up doing people wrong, and just to learn more, they began to steal and experiment on relics, magaras, artifacts… and even people.

I wish I could change them, but for now, all I can do is take care of my dear little granddaughter. I will teach her well.”

[Old man Arifa's thoughts about the Dayoriah Clan]
`,
	`“Dear Uncle, I'm finally up and about! Training is hard, but after my illness, I'm more and more convinced it's necessary. Those great harmonic celmists who can control illusions, lights and shadows, they definitely needed to work like demons to get so powerful. I won't lose to my peers. And I'll certainly catch up. No matter what.”

[Letter to a man call “Uncle Baref”, signed “Divel”]
`,
	`“A petal in darkness is showing at last
revealing its color of violet and white,
a little drop of water
on the corner of its smile,
recovers the tears that were shed in the past.”
